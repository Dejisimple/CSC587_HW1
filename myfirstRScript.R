## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
su = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 2)
hist(values)

```
